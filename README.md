This is my personal blog. To view it, visit https://thebluearchive.github.io/blog/.

To build it yourself, first clone the repository. Then, run the following commands:

```
cd docs
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you need to install jekyll, you can do so by following the instructions at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/.
